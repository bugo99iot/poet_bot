Do you understand my need? <br/>Do you know the greatness of my patience? <br/><br/><br/>Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying <br/>To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any <br/>Secret communication between angels that will carry to <br/>You my complaint? <br/><br/><br/>Where are you, my beautiful star?

All times I have enjoy'd <br/>Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those <br/>That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when <br/>Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades <br/>Vext the dim sea. I am become a name; <br/>For always roaming with a hungry heart <br/>Much have I seen and known,-- cities of men <br/>And manners, climates, councils, governments, <br/>Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,-- <br/>And drunk delight of battle with my peers, <br/>Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. <br/>I am a part of all that I have met; <br/>Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' <br/>Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades <br/>For ever and for ever when I move. <br/>How dull it is to pause, to make an end, <br/>To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! <br/>As tho' to breathe were life!

He works his work, I mine. <br/>There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail; <br/>There gloom the dark, broad seas.

Come, my friends. <br/>'T is not too late to seek a newer world. <br/>Push off, and sitting well in order smite <br/>The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds <br/>To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths <br/>Of all the western stars, until I die. <br/>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; <br/>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, <br/>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. <br/>Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' <br/>We are not now that strength which in old days <br/>Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,-- <br/>One equal temper of heroic hearts, <br/>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will <br/>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

John Donne,"PERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he <br/>   knows not it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so <br/>   much better than I am, as that they who are about me, and see my <br/>   state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that. The <br/>   church is Catholic, universal, so are all her actions; all that she <br/>   does belongs to all. When she baptizes a child, that action <br/>   concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that body which <br/>   is my head too, and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member. <br/>   And when she buries a man, that action concerns me: all mankind is <br/>   of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is <br/>   not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; <br/>   and every chapter must be so translated; God employs several <br/>   translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, <br/>   some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every <br/>   translation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves <br/>   again for that library where every book shall lie open to one <br/>   another. As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not <br/>   upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come, so this <br/>   bell calls us all; but how much more me, who am brought so near the <br/>   door by this sickness. There was a contention as far as a suit (in <br/>   which both piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were <br/>   mingled), which of the religious orders should ring to prayers <br/>   first in the morning; and it was determined, that they should ring <br/>   first that rose earliest. If we understand aright the dignity of <br/>   this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to <br/>   make it ours by rising early, in that application, that it might be <br/>   ours as well as his, whose indeed it is. The bell doth toll for him <br/>   that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that <br/>   minute that this occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God. <br/>   Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes <br/>   off his eye from a comet when that breaks out? Who bends not his <br/>   ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove <br/>   it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this <br/>   world? No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece <br/>   of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by <br/>   the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as <br/>   well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's <br/>   death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and <br/>   therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for <br/>   thee. Neither can we call this a begging of misery, or a borrowing <br/>   of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves, but <br/>   must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the <br/>   misery of our neighbours. Truly it were an excusable covetousness <br/>   if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath <br/>   enough of it. No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and <br/>   ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction. If a man <br/>   carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none <br/>   coined into current money, his treasure will not defray him as he <br/>   travels. Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not <br/>   current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our <br/>   home, heaven, by it. Another man may be sick too, and sick to <br/>   death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a <br/>   mine, and be of no use to him; but this bell, that tells me of his <br/>   affliction, digs out and applies that gold to me: if by this <br/>   consideration of another's danger I take mine own into <br/>   contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my recourse to my <br/>   God, who is our only security.

He didn't have to beg; <br/>Smiling they wrote his lie: aged nineteen years. <br/><br/>Germans he scarcely thought of; all their guilt, <br/>And Austria's, did not move him. And no fears <br/>Of Fear came yet. He thought of jewelled hilts <br/>For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes; <br/>And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears; <br/>Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits. <br/>And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers. <br/><br/>Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal. <br/>Only a solemn man who brought him fruits <br/>Thanked him; and then enquired about his soul. <br/><br/>Now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes, <br/>And do what things the rules consider wise, <br/>And take whatever pity they may dole. <br/>Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes <br/>Passed from him to the strong men that were whole. <br/>How cold and late it is!

their sturdy stroke!<br/><br/>Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,<br/>Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;<br/>Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile<br/>The short and simple annals of the

of death?<br/><br/>Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid<br/>Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;<br/>Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,<br/>Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.<br/><br/>But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page<br/>Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;<br/>Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,<br/>And froze the genial current of the

blood.<br/><br/>Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,<br/>The threats of pain and ruin to despise,<br/>To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,<br/>And read their history in a nation's eyes,<br/><br/>Their lot forbade: nor circumscribed alone<br/>Their glowing virtues, but their crimes confined;<br/>Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,<br/>And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,<br/><br/>The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,<br/>To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,<br/>Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride<br/>With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.<br/><br/>Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,<br/>Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;<br/>Along the cool sequester'd vale of life<br/>They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.<br/><br/>Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect<br/>Some frail memorial still erected nigh,<br/>With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,<br/>Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.<br/><br/>Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,<br/>The place of fame and elegy supply:<br/>And many a holy text around she strews,<br/>That teach the rustic moralist to die.<br/><br/>For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,<br/>This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,<br/>Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,<br/>Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?<br/><br/>On some fond breast the parting soul relies,<br/>Some pious drops the closing eye requires;<br/>Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,<br/>Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires.<br/><br/>For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,<br/>Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;<br/>If chance, by lonely contemplation led,<br/>Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,<br/><br/>Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,<br/>'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn<br/>Brushing with hasty steps the dews away<br/>To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.<br/><br/>'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech<br/>That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,<br/>His listless length at noontide would he stretch,<br/>And pore upon the brook that babbles by.<br/><br/>'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,<br/>Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,<br/>Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,<br/>Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.<br/><br/>'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,<br/>Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;<br/>Another came; nor yet beside the rill,<br/>Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;<br/><br/>'The next with dirges due in sad array<br/>Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne.<br/>Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay<br/>Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn:'<br/><br/>THE EPITAPH<br/><br/><i>Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth<br/>A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.<br/>Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,<br/>And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.<br/><br/>Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,<br/>Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:<br/>He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,<br/>He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.<br/><br/>No farther seek his merits to disclose,<br/>Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,<br/>(There they alike in trembling hope repose,)<br/>The bosom of his Father and

Edwin Muir,"Barely a twelvemonth after<br/>The seven days war that put the world to sleep,<br/>Late in the evening the strange horses came.<br/>By then we had made our covenant with silence,<br/>But in the first few days it was so still<br/>We listened to our breathing and were afraid.<br/>On the second day<br/>The radios failed; we turned the knobs; no answer.<br/>On the third day a warship passed us, heading north,<br/>Dead bodies piled on the deck. On the sixth day<br/>A plane plunged over us into the sea. Thereafter<br/>Nothing. The radios dumb; <br/>And still they stand in corners of our kitchens,<br/>And stand, perhaps, turned on, in a million rooms<br/>All over the world. But now if they should speak,<br/>If on a sudden they should speak again,<br/>If on the stroke of noon a voice should speak,<br/>We would not listen, we would not let it bring<br/>That old bad world that swallowed its children quick<br/>At one great gulp. We would not have it again.<br/>Sometimes we think of the nations lying asleep,<br/>Curled blindly in impenetrable sorrow,<br/>And then the thought confounds us with its strangeness.<br/>The tractors lie about our fields; at evening<br/>They look like dank sea-monsters couched and waiting.<br/>We leave them where they are and let them rust:<br/>'They'll molder away and be like other loam.'<br/>We make our oxen drag our rusty plows,<br/>Long laid aside. We have gone back<br/>Far past our fathers' land.<br/>And then, that evening<br/>Late in the summer the strange horses came.<br/>We heard a distant tapping on the road,<br/>A deepening drumming; it stopped, went on again<br/>And at the corner changed to hollow thunder.<br/>We saw the heads<br/>Like a wild wave charging and were afraid.<br/>We had sold our horses in our fathers' time<br/>To buy new tractors. Now they were strange to us<br/>As fabulous steeds set on an ancient shield.<br/>Or illustrations in a book of knights.<br/>We did not dare go near them. Yet they waited,<br/>Stubborn and shy, as if they had been sent<br/>By an old command to find our whereabouts<br/>And that long-lost archaic companionship.<br/>In the first moment we had never a thought<br/>That they were creatures to be owned and used.<br/>Among them were some half a dozen colts<br/>Dropped in some wilderness of the broken world,<br/>Yet new as if they had come from their own Eden.<br/>Since then they have pulled our plows and borne our loads<br/>But that free servitude still can pierce our hearts.<br/>Our life is changed; their coming our beginning.

How I long with you to pass my days, <br/>Invoke the muses, and resound your praise; <br/>Your praise the birds shall chant in ev'ry grove, <br/>And winds shall waft it to the pow'rs above. <br/>But wou'd you sing, and rival Orpheus' strain, <br/>The wond'ring forests soon shou'd dance again, <br/>The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call, <br/>And headlong streams hang list'ning in their fall! <br/>But see, the shepherds shun the noon-day heat, <br/>The lowing herds to murm'ring brooks retreat, <br/>To closer shades the panting flocks remove, <br/>Ye Gods! And is there no relief for Love? <br/>But soon the sun with milder rays descends<br/>To the cool ocean, where his journey ends; <br/>On me Love's fiercer flames for ever prey, <br/>By night he scorches, as he burns by day.

Edward Lear,"How pleasant to know Mr. Lear, <br/>Who has written such volumes of stuff. <br/>Some think him ill-tempered and queer, <br/>But a few find him pleasant enough. <br/><br/>His mind is concrete and fastidious, <br/>His nose is remarkably big; <br/>His visage is more or less hideous, <br/>His beard it resembles a wig. <br/><br/>He has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers, <br/>(Leastways if you reckon two thumbs); <br/>He used to be one of the singers, <br/>But now he is one of the dumbs. <br/><br/>He sits in a beautiful parlour, <br/>With hundreds of books on the wall; <br/>He drinks a great deal of marsala, <br/>But never gets tipsy at all. <br/><br/>He has many friends, laymen and clerical, <br/>Old Foss is the name of his cat; <br/>His body is perfectly spherical, <br/>He weareth a runcible hat. <br/><br/>When he walks in waterproof white, <br/>The children run after him so! <br/>Calling out, ""He's gone out in his night- <br/>Gown, that crazy old Englishman, oh!"" <br/><br/>He weeps by the side of the ocean, <br/>He weeps on the top of the hill; <br/>He purchases pancakes and lotion, <br/>And chocolate shrimps from the mill. <br/><br/>He reads, but he does not speak, Spanish, <br/>He cannot abide ginger beer; <br/>Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish, <br/>How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!

Henry Lawson,"<br/>The brooding ghosts of Australian night have gone from the bush and town; <br/>My spirit revives in the morning breeze, <br/> though it died when the sun went down; <br/>The river is high and the stream is strong, <br/> and the grass is green and tall, <br/>And I fain would think that this world of ours is a good world after all. <br/> <br/>The light of passion in dreamy eyes, and a page of truth well read, <br/>The glorious thrill in a heart grown cold of the spirit I thought was dead, <br/>A song that goes to a comrade's heart, and a tear of pride let fall -- <br/>And my soul is strong! and the world to me is a grand world after all! <br/> <br/>Let our enemies go by their old dull tracks, <br/> and theirs be the fault or shame <br/>(The man is bitter against the world who has only himself to blame); <br/>Let the darkest side of the past be dark, and only the good recall; <br/>For I must believe that the world, my dear, is a kind world after all. <br/> <br/>It well may be that I saw too plain, and it may be I was blind; <br/>But I'll keep my face to the dawning light, <br/> though the devil may stand behind! <br/>Though the devil may stand behind my back, I'll not see his shadow fall, <br/>But read the signs in the morning stars of a good world after all. <br/> <br/>Rest, for your eyes are weary, girl -- you have driven the worst away -- <br/>The ghost of the man that I might have been is gone from my heart to-day; <br/>We'll live for life and the best it brings till our twilight shadows fall; <br/>My heart grows brave, and the world, my girl, is a good world after all.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"IN SEVEN PARTS<br/><br/>Facile credo, plures esse Naturas invisibiles quam visibiles in rerum<br/>universitate. Sed horum omnium familiam quis nobis enarrabit ? et gradus et<br/>cognationes et discrimina et singulorum munera ? Quid agunt ? quae loca<br/>habitant ? Harum rerum notitiam semper ambivit ingenium humanum, nunquam<br/>attigit.

unhand me, grey-beard loon !'<br/>   Eftsoons his hand dropt he.<br/><br/>The Wedding-Guest is spell-bound by the eye of the old seafaring man, and<br/>constrained to hear his tale.<br/><br/>   He holds him with his glittering eye--<br/>   The Wedding-Guest stood still,<br/>   And listens like a three years' child :<br/>   The Mariner hath his will.<br/><br/>   The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone :<br/>   He cannot choose but hear ;<br/>   And thus spake on that ancient man,<br/>   The bright-eyed Mariner.<br/><br/>   `The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,<br/>   Merrily did we drop<br/>   Below the kirk, below the hill,<br/>   Below the lighthouse top.<br/><br/>The Mariner tells how the ship sailed southward with a good wind and fair<br/>weather, till it reached the Line.<br/><br/>   The Sun came up upon the left,<br/>   Out of the sea came he !<br/>   And he shone bright, and on the right<br/>   Went down into the sea.<br/><br/>   Higher and higher every day,<br/>   Till over the mast at noon--'<br/>   The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<br/>   For he heard the loud bassoon.<br/><br/>The Wedding-Guest heareth the bridal music ; but the Mariner continueth his<br/>tale.<br/><br/>   The bride hath paced into the hall,<br/>   Red as a rose is she ;<br/>   Nodding their heads before her goes<br/>   The merry minstrelsy.<br/><br/>   The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,<br/>   Yet he cannot choose but hear ;<br/>   And thus spake on that ancient man,<br/>   The bright-eyed Mariner.<br/><br/>The ship driven by a storm toward the south pole.<br/><br/>   `And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he<br/>   Was tyrannous and strong :<br/>   He struck with his o'ertaking wings,<br/>   And chased us south along.<br/><br/>   With sloping masts and dipping prow,<br/>   As who pursued with yell and blow<br/>   Still treads the shadow of his foe,<br/>   And forward bends his head,<br/>   The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,<br/>   The southward aye we fled.<br/><br/>   And now there came both mist and snow,<br/>   And it grew wondrous cold :<br/>   And ice, mast-high, came floating by,<br/>   As green as emerald.<br/><br/>The land of ice, and of fearful sounds where no living thing was to be<br/>seen.<br/><br/>   And through the drifts the snowy clifts<br/>   Did send a dismal sheen :<br/>   Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--<br/>   The ice was all between.<br/><br/>   The ice was here, the ice was there,<br/>   The ice was all around :<br/>   It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<br/>   Like noises in a swound !<br/><br/>Till a great sea-bird, called the Albatross, came through the snow-fog, and<br/>was received with great joy and hospitality.<br/><br/>   At length did cross an Albatross,<br/>   Thorough the fog it came ;<br/>   As if it had been a Christian soul,<br/>   We hailed it in God's name.<br/><br/>   It ate the food it ne'er had eat,<br/>   And round and round it flew.<br/>   The ice did split with a thunder-fit ;<br/>   The helmsman steered us through !<br/><br/>And lo ! the Albatross proveth a bird of good omen, and followeth the ship<br/>as it returned northward through fog and floating ice.<br/><br/>   And a good south wind sprung up behind ;<br/>   The Albatross did follow,<br/>   And every day, for food or play,<br/>   Came to the mariner's hollo !<br/><br/>   In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<br/>   It perched for vespers nine ;<br/>   Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<br/>   Glimmered the white Moon-shine.'<br/><br/>The ancient Mariner inhospitably killeth the pious bird of good omen.<br/><br/>   `God save thee, ancient Mariner !<br/>   From the fiends, that plague thee thus !--<br/>   Why look'st thou so ?'--With my cross-bow<br/>   I shot the ALBATROSS.<br/><br/>PART II<br/><br/>   The Sun now rose upon the right :<br/>   Out of the sea came he,<br/>   Still hid in mist, and on the left<br/>   Went down into the sea.<br/><br/>   And the good south wind still blew behind,<br/>   But no sweet bird did follow,<br/>   Nor any day for food or play<br/>   Came to the mariners' hollo !<br/><br/>His shipmates cry out against the ancient Mariner, for killing the bird of<br/>good luck.<br/><br/>   And I had done an hellish thing,<br/>   And it would work 'em woe :<br/>   For all averred, I had killed the bird<br/>   That made the breeze to blow.<br/>   Ah wretch ! said they, the bird to slay,<br/>   That made the breeze to blow !<br/><br/>But when the fog cleared off, they justify the same, and thus make<br/>themselves accomplices in the crime.<br/><br/>   Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,<br/>   The glorious Sun uprist :<br/>   Then all averred, I had killed the bird<br/>   That brought the fog and mist.<br/>   'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,<br/>   That bring the fog and mist.<br/><br/>The fair breeze continues ; the ship enters the Pacific Ocean, and sails<br/>northward, even till it reaches the Line.<br/><br/>   The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,<br/>   The furrow followed free ;<br/>   We were the first that ever burst<br/>   Into that silent sea.<br/><br/>The ship hath been suddenly becalmed.<br/><br/>   Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,<br/>   'Twas sad as sad could be ;<br/>   And we did speak only to break<br/>   The silence of the sea !<br/><br/>   All in a hot and copper sky,<br/>   The bloody Sun, at noon,<br/>   Right up above the mast did stand,<br/>   No bigger than the Moon.<br/><br/>   Day after day, day after day,<br/>   We stuck, nor breath nor motion ;<br/>   As idle as a painted ship<br/>   Upon a painted ocean.<br/><br/>And the Albatross begins to be avenged.<br/><br/>   Water, water, every where,<br/>   And all the boards did shrink ;<br/>   Water, water, every where,<br/>   Nor any drop to drink.<br/><br/>   The very deep did rot : O Christ !<br/>   That ever this should be !<br/>   Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs<br/>   Upon the slimy sea.<br/><br/>   About, about, in reel and rout<br/>   The death-fires danced at night ;<br/>   The water, like a witch's oils,<br/>   Burnt green, and blue and white.<br/><br/>A Spirit had followed them ; one of the invisible inhabitants of this<br/>planet, neither departed souls nor angels ; concerning whom the learned<br/>Jew, Josephus, and the Platonic Constantinopolitan, Michael Psellus, may be<br/>consulted. They are very numerous, and there is no climate or element<br/>without one or more.<br/><br/>   And some in dreams assuréd were<br/>   Of the Spirit that plagued us so ;<br/>   Nine fathom deep he had followed us<br/>   From the land of mist and snow.<br/><br/>   And every tongue, through utter drought,<br/>   Was withered at the root ;<br/>   We could not speak, no more than if<br/>   We had been choked with soot.<br/><br/>The shipmates, in their sore distress, would fain throw the whole guilt on<br/>the ancient Mariner : in sign whereof they hang the dead sea-bird round his<br/>neck.<br/><br/>   Ah ! well a-day ! what evil looks<br/>   Had I from old and young !<br/>   Instead of the cross, the Albatross<br/>   About my neck was hung.<br/><br/>PART III<br/><br/>   There passed a weary time. Each throat<br/>   Was parched, and glazed each eye.<br/>   A weary time ! a weary time !<br/>   How glazed each weary eye,<br/>   When looking westward, I beheld<br/>   A something in the sky.<br/><br/>The ancient Mariner beholdeth a sign in the element afar off.<br/><br/>   At first it seemed a little speck,<br/>   And then it seemed a mist ;<br/>   It moved and moved, and took at last<br/>   A certain shape, I wist.<br/><br/>   A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist !<br/>   And still it neared and neared :<br/>   As if it dodged a water-sprite,<br/>   It plunged and tacked and veered.<br/><br/>At its nearer approach, it seemeth him to be a ship ; and at a dear ransom<br/>he freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst.<br/><br/>   With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,<br/>   We could nor laugh nor wail ;<br/>   Through utter drought all dumb we stood !<br/>   I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,<br/>   And cried, A sail ! a sail !<br/><br/>A flash of joy ;<br/><br/>   With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,<br/>   Agape they heard me call :<br/>   Gramercy ! they for joy did grin,<br/>   And all at once their breath drew in,<br/>   As they were drinking all.<br/><br/>And horror follows. For can it be a ship that comes onward without wind or<br/>tide ?<br/><br/>   See ! see ! (I cried) she tacks no more !<br/>   Hither to work us weal ;<br/>   Without a breeze, without a tide,<br/>   She steadies with upright keel !<br/><br/>   The western wave was all a-flame.<br/>   The day was well nigh done !<br/>   Almost upon the western wave<br/>   Rested the broad bright Sun ;<br/>   When that strange shape drove suddenly<br/>   Betwixt us and the Sun.<br/><br/>It seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship.<br/><br/>   And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,<br/>   (Heaven's Mother send us grace !)<br/>   As if through a dungeon-grate he peered<br/>   With broad and burning face.<br/><br/>And its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting Sun.<br/><br/>   Alas ! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)<br/>   How fast she nears and nears !<br/>   Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,<br/>   Like restless gossameres ?<br/><br/>The Spectre-Woman and her Death-mate, and no other on board the skeleton<br/>ship.<br/><br/>   And those her ribs through which the Sun<br/>   Did peer, as through a grate ?<br/>   And is that Woman all her crew ?<br/>   Is that a DEATH ? and are there two ?<br/>   Is DEATH that woman's mate ?<br/><br/>[first version of this stanza through the end of Part III]<br/><br/>Like vessel, like crew !<br/><br/>   Her lips were red, her looks were free,<br/>   Her locks were yellow as gold :<br/>   Her skin was as white as leprosy,<br/>   The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,<br/>   Who thicks man's blood with cold.<br/><br/>Death and Life-in-Death have diced for the ship's crew, and she (the<br/>latter) winneth the ancient Mariner.<br/><br/>   The naked hulk alongside came,<br/>   And the twain were casting dice ;<br/>   `The game is done ! I've won ! I've won !'<br/>   Quoth she, and whistles thrice.<br/><br/>No twilight within the courts of the Sun.<br/><br/>   The Sun's rim dips ; the stars rush out :<br/>   At one stride comes the dark ;<br/>   With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,<br/>   Off shot the spectre-bark.<br/><br/>At the rising of the Moon,<br/><br/>   We listened and looked sideways up !<br/>   Fear at my heart, as at a cup,<br/>   My life-blood seemed to sip !<br/>   The stars were dim, and thick the night,<br/>   The steerman's face by his lamp gleamed white ;<br/>   From the sails the dew did drip--<br/>   Till clomb above the eastern bar<br/>   The hornéd Moon, with one bright star<br/>   Within the nether tip.<br/><br/>One after another,<br/><br/>   One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,<br/>   Too quick for groan or sigh,<br/>   Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,<br/>   And cursed me with his eye.<br/><br/>His shipmates drop down dead.<br/><br/>   Four times fifty living men,<br/>   (And I heard nor sigh nor groan)<br/>   With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,<br/>   They dropped down one by one.<br/><br/>But Life-in-Death begins her work on the ancient Mariner.<br/><br/>   The souls did from their bodies fly,--<br/>   They fled to bliss or woe !<br/>   And every soul, it passed me by,<br/>   Like the whizz of my cross-bow !<br/><br/>PART IV<br/><br/>The Wedding-Guest feareth that a Spirit is talking to him ;<br/><br/>   `I fear thee, ancient Mariner !<br/>   I fear thy skinny hand !<br/>   And thou art long, and lank, and brown,<br/>   As is the ribbed sea-sand.<br/><br/>(Coleridge's note on above stanza)<br/><br/>   I fear thee and thy glittering eye,<br/>   And thy skinny hand, so brown.'--<br/>   Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest !<br/>   This body dropt not down.<br/><br/>But the ancient Mariner assureth him of his bodily life, and proceedeth to<br/>relate his horrible penance.<br/><br/>   Alone, alone, all, all alone,<br/>   Alone on a wide wide sea !<br/>   And never a saint took pity on<br/>   My soul in agony.<br/><br/>He despiseth the creatures of the calm,<br/><br/>   The many men, so beautiful !<br/>   And they all dead did lie :<br/>   And a thousand thousand slimy things<br/>   Lived on ; and so did I.<br/><br/>And envieth that they should live, and so many lie dead.<br/><br/>   I looked upon the rotting sea,<br/>   And drew my eyes away ;<br/>   I looked upon the rotting deck,<br/>   And there the dead men lay.<br/><br/>   I looked to heaven, and tried to pray ;<br/>   But or ever a prayer had gusht,<br/>   A wicked whisper came, and made<br/>   My heart as dry as dust.<br/><br/>   I closed my lids, and kept them close,<br/>   And the balls like pulses beat ;<br/>   For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky<br/>   Lay like a load on my weary eye,<br/>   And the dead were at my feet.<br/><br/>But the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men.<br/><br/>   The cold sweat melted from their limbs,<br/>   Nor rot nor reek did they :<br/>   The look with which they looked on me<br/>   Had never passed away.<br/><br/>   An orphan's curse would drag to hell<br/>   A spirit from on high ;<br/>   But oh ! more horrible than that<br/>   Is the curse in a dead man's eye !<br/>   Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,<br/>   And yet I could not die.<br/><br/>In his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the journeying Moon,<br/>and the stars that still sojourn, yet still move onward ;

the Mariner awakes, and his penance<br/>begins anew.<br/><br/>   I woke, and we were sailing on<br/>   As in a gentle weather :<br/>   'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high ;<br/>   The dead men stood together.<br/><br/>   All stood together on the deck,<br/>   For a charnel-dungeon fitter :<br/>   All fixed on me their stony eyes,<br/>   That in the Moon did glitter.<br/><br/>   The pang, the curse, with which they died,<br/>   Had never passed away :<br/>   I could not draw my eyes from theirs,<br/>   Nor turn them up to pray.<br/><br/>The curse is finally expiated.<br/><br/>   And now this spell was snapt : once more<br/>   I viewed the ocean green,<br/>   And looked far forth, yet little saw<br/>   Of what had else been seen--<br/><br/>   Like one, that on a lonesome road<br/>   Doth walk in fear and dread,<br/>   And having once turned round walks on,<br/>   And turns no more his head ;<br/>   Because he knows, a frightful fiend<br/>   Doth close behind him tread.<br/><br/>   But soon there breathed a wind on me,<br/>   Nor sound nor motion made :<br/>   Its path was not upon the sea,<br/>   In ripple or in shade.<br/><br/>   It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek<br/>   Like a meadow-gale of spring--<br/>   It mingled strangely with my fears,<br/>   Yet it felt like a welcoming.<br/><br/>   Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,<br/>   Yet she sailed softly too :<br/>   Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--<br/>   On me alone it blew.<br/><br/>And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country.<br/><br/>   Oh ! dream of joy ! is this indeed<br/>   The light-house top I see ?<br/>   Is this the hill ? is this the kirk ?<br/>   Is this mine own countree ?<br/><br/>   We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,<br/>   And I with sobs did pray--<br/>   O let me be awake, my God !<br/>   Or let me sleep alway.<br/><br/>   The harbour-bay was clear as glass,<br/>   So smoothly it was strewn !<br/>   And on the bay the moonlight lay,<br/>   And the shadow of the Moon.<br/><br/>[Additional stanzas, dropped after the first edition.]<br/><br/>   The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,<br/>   That stands above the rock :<br/>   The moonlight steeped in silentness<br/>   The steady weathercock.<br/><br/>The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies,<br/><br/>   And the bay was white with silent light,<br/>   Till rising from the same,<br/>   Full many shapes, that shadows were,<br/>   In crimson colours came.<br/><br/>And appear in their own forms of light.<br/><br/>   A little distance from the prow<br/>   Those crimson shadows were :<br/>   I turned my eyes upon the deck--<br/>   Oh, Christ ! what saw I there !<br/><br/>   Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,<br/>   And, by the holy rood !<br/>   A man all light, a seraph-man,<br/>   On every corse there stood.<br/><br/>   This seraph-band, each waved his hand :<br/>   It was a heavenly sight !<br/>   They stood as signals to the land,<br/>   Each one a lovely light ;<br/><br/>   This seraph-band, each waved his hand,<br/>   No voice did they impart--<br/>   No voice ; but oh ! the silence sank<br/>   Like music on my heart.<br/><br/>   But soon I heard the dash of oars,<br/>   I heard the Pilot's cheer ;<br/>   My head was turned perforce away<br/>   And I saw a boat appear.<br/><br/>[Additional stanza, dropped after the first edition.]<br/><br/>   The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,<br/>   I heard them coming fast :<br/>   Dear Lord in Heaven ! it was a joy<br/>   The dead men could not blast.<br/><br/>   I saw a third--I heard his voice :<br/>   It is the Hermit good !<br/>   He singeth loud his godly hymns<br/>   That he makes in the wood.<br/>   He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away<br/>   The Albatross's blood.<br/><br/>PART VII<br/><br/>The Hermit of the Wood,<br/><br/>   This Hermit good lives in that wood<br/>   Which slopes down to the sea.<br/>   How loudly his sweet voice he rears !<br/>   He loves to talk with marineres<br/>   That come from a far countree.<br/><br/>   He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--<br/>   He hath a cushion plump :<br/>   It is the moss that wholly hides<br/>   The rotted old oak-stump.<br/><br/>   The skiff-boat neared : I heard them talk,<br/>   `Why, this is strange, I trow !<br/>   Where are those lights so many and fair,<br/>   That signal made but now ?'<br/><br/>Approacheth the ship with wonder.<br/><br/>   `Strange, by my faith !' the Hermit said--<br/>   `And they answered not our cheer !<br/>   The planks looked warped ! and see those sails,<br/>   How thin they are and sere !<br/>   I never saw aught like to them,<br/>   Unless perchance it were<br/><br/>   Brown skeletons of leaves that lag<br/>   My forest-brook along ;<br/>   When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,<br/>   And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,<br/>   That eats the she-wolf's young.'<br/><br/>   `Dear Lord ! it hath a fiendish look--<br/>   (The Pilot made reply)<br/>   I am a-feared'--`Push on, push on !'<br/>   Said the Hermit cheerily.<br/><br/>   The boat came closer to the ship,<br/>   But I nor spake nor stirred ;<br/>   The boat came close beneath the ship,<br/>   And straight a sound was heard.<br/><br/>The ship suddenly sinketh.<br/><br/>   Under the water it rumbled on,<br/>   Still louder and more dread :<br/>   It reached the ship, it split the bay ;<br/>   The ship went down like lead.<br/><br/>The ancient Mariner is saved in the Pilot's boat.<br/><br/>   Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,<br/>   Which sky and ocean smote,<br/>   Like one that hath been seven days drowned<br/>   My body lay afloat ;<br/>   But swift as dreams, myself I found<br/>   Within the Pilot's boat.<br/><br/>   Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,<br/>   The boat spun round and round ;<br/>   And all was still, save that the hill<br/>   Was telling of the sound.<br/><br/>   I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked<br/>   And fell down in a fit ;<br/>   The holy Hermit raised his eyes,<br/>   And prayed where he did sit.<br/><br/>   I took the oars : the Pilot's boy,<br/>   Who now doth crazy go,<br/>   Laughed loud and long, and all the while<br/>   His eyes went to and fro.<br/>   `Ha ! ha !' quoth he, `full plain I see,<br/>   The Devil knows how to row.'<br/><br/>   And now, all in my own countree,<br/>   I stood on the firm land !<br/>   The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,<br/>   And scarcely he could stand.<br/><br/>The ancient Mariner earnestly entreateth the Hermit to shrieve him ; and<br/>the penance of life falls on him.<br/><br/>   `O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man !'<br/>   The Hermit crossed his brow.<br/>   `Say quick,' quoth he, `I bid thee say--<br/>   What manner of man art thou ?'<br/><br/>   Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched<br/>   With a woful agony,<br/>   Which forced me to begin my tale ;<br/>   And then it left me free.<br/><br/>And ever and anon through out his future life an agony constraineth him to<br/>travel from land to land ;<br/><br/>   Since then, at an uncertain hour,<br/>   That agony returns :<br/>   And till my ghastly tale is told,<br/>   This heart within me burns.<br/><br/>   I pass, like night, from land to land ;<br/>   I have strange power of speech ;<br/>   That moment that his face I see,<br/>   I know the man that must hear me :<br/>   To him my tale I teach.<br/><br/>   What loud uproar bursts from that door !<br/>   The wedding-guests are there :<br/>   But in the garden-bower the bride<br/>   And bride-maids singing are :<br/>   And hark the little vesper bell,<br/>   Which biddeth me to prayer !<br/><br/>   O Wedding-Guest ! this soul hath been<br/>   Alone on a wide wide sea :<br/>   So lonely 'twas, that God himself<br/>   Scarce seeméd there to be.<br/><br/>   O sweeter than the marriage-feast,<br/>   'Tis sweeter far to me,<br/>   To walk together to the kirk<br/>   With a goodly company !--<br/><br/>   To walk together to the kirk,<br/>   And all together pray,<br/>   While each to his great Father bends,<br/>   Old men, and babes, and loving friends<br/>   And youths and maidens gay !<br/><br/>And to teach, by his own example, love and reverence to all things that God<br/>made and loveth.<br/><br/>   Farewell, farewell ! but this I tell<br/>   To thee, thou Wedding-Guest !<br/>   He prayeth well, who loveth well<br/>   Both man and bird and beast.<br/><br/>   He prayeth best, who loveth best<br/>   All things both great and small ;<br/>   For the dear God who loveth us,<br/>   He made and loveth all.<br/><br/>   The Mariner, whose eye is bright,<br/>   Whose beard with age is hoar,<br/>   Is gone : and now the Wedding-Guest<br/>   Turned from the bridegroom's door.<br/><br/>   He went like one that hath been stunned,<br/>   And is of sense forlorn :<br/>   A sadder and a wiser man,<br/>   He rose the morrow morn.

Night and water <br/>Pour to one rip of darkness, the Harbour floats <br/>In the air, the Cross hangs upside-down in water. <br/><br/>Why do I think of you, dead man, why thieve <br/>These profitless lodgings from the flukes of thought <br/>Anchored in Time? You have gone from earth, <br/>Gone even from the meaning of a name; <br/>Yet something's there, yet something forms its lips <br/>And hits and cries against the ports of space, <br/>Beating their sides to make its fury heard. <br/><br/>Are you shouting at me, dead man, squeezing your face <br/>In agonies of speech on speechless panes? <br/>Cry louder, beat the windows, bawl your name! <br/><br/>But I hear nothing, nothing...only bells, <br/>Five bells, the bumpkin calculus of Time. <br/>Your echoes die, your voice is dowsed by Life, <br/>There's not a mouth can fly the pygmy strait - <br/>Nothing except the memory of some bones <br/>Long shoved away, and sucked away, in mud; <br/>And unimportant things you might have done, <br/>Or once I thought you did; but you forgot, <br/>And all have now forgotten - looks and words <br/>And slops of beer; your coat with buttons off, <br/>Your gaunt chin and pricked eye, and raging tales <br/>Of Irish kings and English perfidy, <br/>And dirtier perfidy of publicans <br/>Groaning to God from Darlinghurst. <br/>Five bells. <br/><br/>Then I saw the road, I heard the thunder <br/>Tumble, and felt the talons of the rain <br/>The night we came to Moorebank in slab-dark, <br/>So dark you bore no body, had no face, <br/>But a sheer voice that rattled out of air <br/>(As now you'd cry if I could break the glass), <br/>A voice that spoke beside me in the bush, <br/>Loud for a breath or bitten off by wind, <br/>Of Milton, melons, and the Rights of Man, <br/>And blowing flutes, and how Tahitian girls <br/>Are brown and angry-tongued, and Sydney girls <br/>Are white and angry-tongued, or so you'd found. <br/>But all I heard was words that didn't join <br/>So Milton became melons, melons girls, <br/>And fifty mouths, it seemed, were out that night, <br/>And in each tree an Ear was bending down, <br/>Or something that had just run, gone behind the grass, <br/>When blank and bone-white, like a maniac's thought, <br/>The naphtha-flash of lightning slit the sky, <br/>Knifing the dark with deathly photographs. <br/>There's not so many with so poor a purse <br/>Or fierce a need, must fare by night like that, <br/>Five miles in darkness on a country track, <br/>But when you do, that's what you think. <br/>Five bells. <br/><br/>In Melbourne, your appetite had gone, <br/>Your angers too; they had been leeched away <br/>By the soft archery of summer rains <br/>And the sponge-paws of wetness, the slow damp <br/>That stuck the leaves of living, snailed the mind, <br/>And showed your bones, that had been sharp with rage, <br/>The sodden ectasies of rectitude. <br/>I thought of what you'd written in faint ink, <br/>Your journal with the sawn-off lock, that stayed behind <br/>With other things you left, all without use, <br/>All without meaning now, except a sign <br/>That someone had been living who now was dead: <br/>""At Labassa. Room 6 x 8 <br/>On top of the tower; because of this, very dark <br/>And cold in winter. Everything has been stowed <br/>Into this room - 500 books all shapes <br/>And colours, dealt across the floor <br/>And over sills and on the laps of chairs; <br/>Guns, photoes of many differant things <br/>And differant curioes that I obtained..."" <br/><br/>In Sydney, by the spent aquarium-flare <br/>Of penny gaslight on pink wallpaper, <br/>We argued about blowing up the world, <br/>But you were living backward, so each night <br/>You crept a moment closer to the breast, <br/>And they were living, all of them, those frames <br/>And shapes of flesh that had perplexed your youth, <br/>And most your father, the old man gone blind, <br/>With fingers always round a fiddle's neck, <br/>That graveyard mason whose fair monuments <br/>And tablets cut with dreams of piety <br/>Rest on the bosoms of a thousand men <br/>Staked bone by bone, in quiet astonishment <br/>At cargoes they had never thought to bear, <br/>These funeral-cakes of sweet and sculptured stone. <br/><br/>Where have you gone? The tide is over you, <br/>The turn of midnight water's over you, <br/>As Time is over you, and mystery, <br/>And memory, the flood that does not flow. <br/>You have no suburb, like those easier dead <br/>In private berths of dissolution laid - <br/>The tide goes over, the waves ride over you <br/>And let their shadows down like shining hair, <br/>But they are Water; and the sea-pinks bend <br/>Like lilies in your teeth, but they are Weed; <br/>And you are only part of an Idea. <br/>I felt the wet push its black thumb-balls in, <br/>The night you died, I felt your eardrums crack, <br/>And the short agony, the longer dream, <br/>The Nothing that was neither long nor short; <br/>But I was bound, and could not go that way, <br/>But I was blind, and could not feel your hand. <br/>If I could find an answer, could only find <br/>Your meaning, or could say why you were here <br/>Who now are gone, what purpose gave you breath <br/>Or seized it back, might I not hear your voice? <br/><br/>I looked out my window in the dark <br/>At waves with diamond quills and combs of light <br/>That arched their mackerel-backs and smacked the sand <br/>In the moon's drench, that straight enormous glaze, <br/>And ships far off asleep, and Harbour-buoys <br/>Tossing their fireballs wearily each to each, <br/>And tried to hear your voice, but all I heard <br/>Was a boat's whistle, and the scraping squeal <br/>Of seabirds' voices far away, and bells, <br/>Five bells. Five bells coldly ringing out. <br/>Five bells.

'But I gave you everything.'<br/>'Well, you shouldn't have done it. You know what a fellow thinks<br/>When a girl does that.' 'Yes, he talks of her over his drinks<br/>And calles her a--' 'Stop that now, I thought you knew.'<br/>'But it wasn't with anyone else. It was only you.'<br/>'How did I know? I thought you wanted it too.<br/>I thought you were like the rest. Well, what's to be done?'<br/>'To be done' 'Is it all right?' 'Yes.' 'Sure?' 'Yes, but why?'<br/>'I don't know, I thought you where going to cry.<br/>You said you had something to tell me.' 'Yes, I know.<br/>It wasn't anything relly... I think I'll go.'<br/>'Yes, it's late. There's thunder about, a drop of rain<br/>Fell on my hand in the dark. I'll see you again<br/>At the dance next week. You're sure that everything's right?'<br/>'Yes,' 'Well, I'll be going.'

Sir Walter Raleigh,"IF all the world and love were young, <br/>And truth in every shepherd's tongue, <br/>These pretty pleasures might me move <br/>To live with thee and be thy Love. <br/><br/>But Time drives flocks from field to fold; <br/>When rivers rage and rocks grow cold; <br/>And Philomel becometh dumb; <br/>The rest complains of cares to come. <br/><br/>The flowers do fade, and wanton fields <br/>To wayward Winter reckoning yields: <br/>A honey tongue, a heart of gall, <br/>Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall. <br/><br/>Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses, <br/>Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies, <br/>Soon break, soon wither--soon forgotten, <br/>In folly ripe, in reason rotten. <br/><br/>Thy belt of straw and ivy-buds, <br/>Thy coral clasps and amber studs,-- <br/>All these in me no means can move <br/>To come to thee and be thy Love. <br/><br/>But could youth last, and love still breed, <br/>Had joys no date, nor age no need, <br/>Then these delights my mind might move <br/>To live with thee and be thy Love.

Then red ones inked up and that hunger<br/>Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots<br/>Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.<br/>Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills<br/>We trekked and picked until the cans were full<br/>Until the tinkling bottom had been covered<br/>With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned<br/>Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered<br/>With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.<br/>We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.<br/>But when the bath was filled we found a fur,<br/>A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.<br/>The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush<br/>The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.<br/>I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair<br/>That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.<br/>Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not.

Ernest Lawrence Thayer,"The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day; <br/>The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,<br/>And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br/>A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game. <br/><br/>A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest<br/>Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast; <br/>They thought, 'If only Casey could but get a whack at that- <br/>We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.' <br/><br/>But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br/>And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake; <br/>So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br/>For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.<br/><br/>But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br/>And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball; <br/>And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,<br/>There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third. <br/><br/>Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell; <br/>It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell; <br/>It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br/>For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat. <br/><br/>There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place; <br/>There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.<br/>And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br/>No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat. <br/><br/>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt; <br/>Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt; <br/>Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br/>Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip. <br/><br/>And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br/>And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.<br/>Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped- <br/>'That ain't my style,' said Casey. 'Strike one! ' the umpire said. <br/><br/>From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br/>Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore; <br/>'Kill him! Kill the umpire! ' shouted some one on the stand; <br/>And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand. <br/><br/>With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone; <br/>He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on; <br/>He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew; <br/>But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, 'Strike two! ' <br/><br/>'Fraud! ' cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered 'Fraud! '<br/>But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.<br/>They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,<br/>And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again. <br/><br/>The sneer has fled from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate; <br/>He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.<br/>And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go.<br/>And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow. <br/><br/>Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright; <br/>The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,<br/>And somewhere men are laughing, and little children shout; <br/>But there is no joy in Mudville- mighty Casey has struck out.

William Cullen Bryant,"To him who in the love of nature holds<br/>Communion with her visible forms, she speaks<br/>A various language; for his gayer hours<br/>She has a voice of gladness, and a smile<br/>And eloquence of beauty; and she glides<br/>Into his darker musings, with a mild<br/>And healing sympathy that steals away<br/>Their sharpness ere he is aware. When thoughts<br/>Of the last bitter hour come like a blight<br/>Over thy spirit, and sad images<br/>Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,<br/>And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,<br/>Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--<br/>Go forth, under the open sky, and list<br/>To Nature's teachings, while from all around--<br/>Earth and her waters, and the depths of air--<br/>Comes a still voice. Yet a few days, and thee<br/>The all-beholding sun shall see no more<br/>In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,<br/>Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,<br/>Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist<br/>Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim<br/>Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,<br/>And, lost each human trace, surrendering up<br/>Thine individual being, shalt thou go <br/>To mix forever with the elements,<br/>To be a brother to the insensible rock<br/>And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain<br/>Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak<br/>Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold. <br/><br/>Yet not to thine eternal resting-place<br/>Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish<br/>Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down<br/>With patriarchs of the infant world -- with kings,<br/>The powerful of the earth -- the wise, the good,<br/>Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,<br/>All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills<br/>Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun, -- the vales<br/>Stretching in pensive quietness between;<br/>The venerable woods -- rivers that move<br/>In majesty, and the complaining brooks<br/>That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,<br/>Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste,--<br/>Are but the solemn decorations all<br/>Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,<br/>The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,<br/>Are shining on the sad abodes of death<br/>Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread<br/>The globe are but a handful to the tribes<br/>That slumber in its bosom. -- Take the wings<br/>Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,<br/>Or lose thyself in the continuous woods<br/>Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,<br/>Save his own dashings -- yet the dead are there:<br/>And millions in those solitudes, since first<br/>The flight of years began, have laid them down<br/>In their last sleep -- the dead reign there alone. <br/><br/>So shalt thou rest -- and what if thou withdraw<br/>In silence from the living, and no friend<br/>Take note of thy departure? All that breathe<br/>Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh<br/>When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care<br/>Plod on, and each one as before will chase<br/>His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave<br/>Their mirth and their employments, and shall come<br/>And make their bed with thee. As the long train<br/>Of ages glides away, the sons of men--<br/>The youth in life's fresh spring, and he who goes<br/>In the full strength of years, matron and maid,<br/>The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man--<br/>Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,<br/>By those, who in their turn, shall follow them. <br/><br/>So live, that when thy summons comes to join<br/>The innumerable caravan, which moves<br/>To that mysterious realm, where each shall take<br/>His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br/>Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,<br/>Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed<br/>By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave<br/>Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch<br/>About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street. <br/> <br/>The human river dwindles when 'tis past the hour of eight, <br/>Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late; <br/>But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat <br/>The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street -- <br/>  Grinding body, grinding soul, <br/>  Yielding scarce enough to eat -- <br/>Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street. <br/> <br/>And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down <br/>Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town, <br/>Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street, <br/>Tells of the city's unemployed upon his weary beat -- <br/>  Drifting round, drifting round, <br/>  To the tread of listless feet -- <br/>Ah! My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street. <br/> <br/>And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away, <br/>And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day, <br/>Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat, <br/>Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street -- <br/>  Ebbing out, ebbing out, <br/>  To the drag of tired feet, <br/>While my heart is aching dumbly for the faces in the street. <br/> <br/>And now all blurred and smirched with vice the day's sad pages end, <br/>For while the short `large hours' toward the longer `small hours' trend, <br/>With smiles that mock the wearer, and with words that half entreat, <br/>Delilah pleads for custom at the corner of the street -- <br/>  Sinking down, sinking down, <br/>  Battered wreck by tempests beat -- <br/>A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street. <br/> <br/>But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes, <br/>For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums, <br/>Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet, <br/>And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street -- <br/>  Rotting out, rotting out, <br/>  For the lack of air and meat -- <br/>In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street. <br/> <br/>I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure <br/>Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor? <br/>Ah! Mammon's slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror beat, <br/>When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street, <br/>  The wrong things and the bad things <br/>  And the sad things that we meet <br/>In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street. <br/> <br/>I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still, <br/>And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill; <br/>But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet, <br/>They haunted me -- the shadows of those faces in the street, <br/>  Flitting by, flitting by, <br/>  Flitting by with noiseless feet, <br/>And with cheeks but little paler than the real ones in the street. <br/> <br/>Once I cried: `Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure, <br/>Now show me in a vision for the wrongs of Earth a cure.' <br/>And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city's street, <br/>And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet, <br/>  Coming near, coming near, <br/>  To a drum's dull distant beat, <br/>And soon I saw the army that was marching down the street. <br/> <br/>Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall, <br/>The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all, <br/>And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution's heat, <br/>And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street. <br/>  Pouring on, pouring on, <br/>  To a drum's loud threatening beat, <br/>And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street. <br/> <br/>And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course, <br/>The warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse, <br/>But not until a city feels Red Revolution's feet <br/>Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street -- <br/>  The dreadful everlasting strife <br/>  For scarcely clothes and meat <br/>In that pent track of living death -- the city's cruel street.

What flag can we wave?<br/>I wave the flag of stone and seed,<br/>table mat stitched in blue.<br/><br/>I call my father, we talk around the news.<br/>It is too much for him,<br/>neither of his two languages can reach it.<br/>I drive into the country to find sheep, cows,<br/>to plead with the air: <br/>Who calls anyone civilized?<br/>Where can the crying heart graze?<br/>What does a true Arab do now?

As I wander down <br/>The garden-paths. <br/>My dress is richly figured, <br/>And the train <br/>Makes a pink and silver stain <br/>On the gravel, and the thrift <br/>Of the borders. <br/>Just a plate of current fashion, <br/>Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes. <br/>Not a softness anywhere about me, <br/>Only whalebone and brocade. <br/>And I sink on a seat in the shade <br/>Of a lime tree. For my passion <br/>Wars against the stiff brocade. <br/>The daffodils and squills <br/>Flutter in the breeze <br/>As they please. <br/>And I weep; <br/>For the lime-tree is in blossom <br/>And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom. <br/><br/>And the plashing of waterdrops <br/>In the marble fountain <br/>Comes down the garden-paths. <br/>The dripping never stops. <br/>Underneath my stiffened gown <br/>Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin, <br/>A basin in the midst of hedges grown <br/>So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding, <br/>But she guesses he is near, <br/>And the sliding of the water <br/>Seems the stroking of a dear <br/>Hand upon her. <br/>What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown! <br/>I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground. <br/>All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground. <br/><br/>I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths, <br/>And he would stumble after, <br/>Bewildered by my laughter. <br/>I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the <br/>buckles on his shoes. <br/>I would choose <br/>To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths, <br/>A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover. <br/>Till he caught me in the shade, <br/>And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he <br/>clasped me, <br/>Aching, melting, unafraid. <br/>With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops, <br/>And the plopping of the waterdrops, <br/>All about us in the open afternoon-- <br/>I am very like to swoon <br/>With the weight of this brocade, <br/>For the sun sifts through the shade. <br/><br/>Underneath the fallen blossom <br/>In my bosom, <br/>Is a letter I have hid. <br/>It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the <br/>Duke. <br/>""Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell <br/>Died in action Thursday se'nnight."" <br/>As I read it in the white, morning sunlight, <br/>The letters squirmed like snakes. <br/>""Any answer, Madam,"" said my footman. <br/>""No,"" I told him. <br/>""See that the messenger takes some refreshment. <br/>No, no answer."" <br/>And I walked into the garden, <br/>Up and down the patterned paths, <br/>In my stiff, correct brocade. <br/>The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun, <br/>Each one. <br/>I stood upright too, <br/>Held rigid to the pattern <br/>By the stiffness of my gown. <br/>Up and down I walked, <br/>Up and down. <br/><br/>In a month he would have been my husband. <br/>In a month, here, underneath this lime, <br/>We would have broke the pattern; <br/>He for me, and I for him, <br/>He as Colonel, I as Lady, <br/>On this shady seat. <br/>He had a whim <br/>That sunlight carried blessing. <br/>And I answered, ""It shall be as you have said."" <br/>Now he is dead. <br/><br/>In Summer and in Winter I shall walk <br/>Up and down <br/>The patterned garden-paths <br/>In my stiff, brocaded gown. <br/>The squills and daffodils <br/>Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow. <br/>I shall go <br/>Up and down <br/>In my gown. <br/>Gorgeously arrayed, <br/>Boned and stayed. <br/>And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace <br/>By each button, hook, and lace. <br/>For the man who should loose me is dead, <br/>Fighting with the Duke in Flanders, <br/>In a pattern called a war. <br/>Christ!

Robinson Jeffers,"I had walked since dawn and lay down to rest on a bare hillside<br/>Above the ocean. I saw through half-shut eyelids a vulture wheeling<br/>   high up in heaven,<br/>And presently it passed again, but lower and nearer, its orbit<br/>   narrowing,<br/>   I understood then<br/>That I was under inspection. I lay death-still and heard the flight-<br/>   feathers<br/>Whistle above me and make their circle and come nearer.<br/>I could see the naked red head between the great wings<br/>Bear downward staring. I said, 'My dear bird, we are wasting time<br/>   here.<br/>These old bones will still work; they are not for you.' But how<br/>   beautiful<br/>   he looked, gliding down<br/>On those great sails; how beautiful he looked, veering away in the<br/>   sea-light<br/>   over the precipice. I tell you solemnly<br/>That I was sorry to have disappointed him. To be eaten by that beak<br/>   and<br/>   become part of him, to share those wings and those eyes--<br/>What a sublime end of one's body, what an enskyment; what a life<br/>   after death.

There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol <br/>on the cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on <br/>its black cord over the house. On the television <br/>was a cop show. It was in English. Broken bottles <br/>were embedded in the walls around the house to <br/>scoop the kneecaps from a man's legs or cut his <br/>hands to lace. On the windows there were gratings <br/>like those in liquor stores. We had dinner, rack of <br/>lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for <br/>calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, <br/>salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed <br/>the country. There was a brief commercial in <br/>Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was <br/>some talk of how difficult it had become to govern. <br/>The parrot said hello on the terrace. The colonel <br/>told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the <br/>table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say <br/>nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to <br/>bring groceries home. He spilled many human ears on <br/>the table. They were like dried peach halves. There <br/>is no other way to say this. He took one of them in <br/>his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a <br/>water glass. It came alive there. I am tired of <br/>fooling around he said. As for the rights of anyone, <br/>tell your people they can go f--- themselves. He <br/>swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held <br/>the last of his wine in the air. Something for your <br/>poetry, no? he said. Some of the ears on the floor <br/>caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the ears on <br/>the floor were pressed to the ground. <br/><br/>May 1978

John Greenleaf Whittier,"Still sits the school-house by the road, <br/>A ragged beggar sleeping; <br/>Around it still the sumachs grow, <br/>And blackberry-vines are creeping. <br/><br/>Within, the master's desk is seen, <br/>Deep-scarred by raps official; <br/>The warping floor, the battered seats, <br/>The jack-knife's carved initial; <br/><br/>The charcoal frescoes on its wall; <br/>Its door's worn sill, betraying <br/>The feet that, creeping slow to school, <br/>Went storming out to playing! <br/><br/>Long years ago a winter sun <br/>Shone over it at setting; <br/>Lit up its western window-panes, <br/>And low eaves' icy fretting. <br/><br/>It touched the tangled golden curls, <br/>And brown eyes full of grieving, <br/>Of one who still her steps delayed <br/>When all the school were leaving. <br/><br/>For near it stood the little boy <br/>Her childish favor singled; <br/>His cap pulled low upon a face <br/>Where pride and shame were mingled. <br/><br/>Pushing with restless feet the snow <br/>To right and left, he lingered;--- <br/>As restlessly her tiny hands <br/>The blue-checked apron fingered. <br/><br/>He saw her lift her eyes; he felt <br/>The soft hand's light caressing, <br/>And heard the tremble of her voice, <br/>As if a fault confessing. <br/><br/>""I'm sorry that I spelt the word: <br/>I hate to go above you, <br/>Because,""---the brown eyes lower fell,--- <br/>""Because, you see, I love you!"" <br/><br/>Still memory to a gray-haired man <br/>That sweet child-face is showing. <br/>Dear girl! the grasses on her grave <br/>Have forty years been growing! <br/><br/>He lives to learn, in life's hard school, <br/>How few who pass above him <br/>Lament their triumph and his loss, <br/>Like her, because they love him.

Donald Hall,"To grow old is to lose everything. <br/>Aging, everybody knows it. <br/>Even when we are young, <br/>we glimpse it sometimes, and nod our heads <br/>when a grandfather dies.<br/>Then we row for years on the midsummer <br/>pond, ignorant and content. But a marriage,<br/>that began without harm, scatters <br/>into debris on the shore, <br/>and a friend from school drops <br/>cold on a rocky strand.<br/>If a new love carries us <br/>past middle age, our wife will die <br/>at her strongest and most beautiful. <br/>New women come and go. All go. <br/>The pretty lover who announces <br/>that she is temporary<br/>is temporary. The bold woman,<br/>middle-aged against our old age,<br/>sinks under an anxiety she cannot withstand. <br/>Another friend of decades estranges himself <br/>in words that pollute thirty years. <br/>Let us stifle under mud at the pond's edge <br/>and affirm that it is fitting<br/>and delicious to lose everything.

Ernest Christopher Dowson,"We have walked in Love's land a little way,<br/>We have learnt his lesson a little while,<br/>And shall we not part at the end of day,<br/>With a sigh, a smile?<br/><br/>A little while in the shine of the sun,<br/>We were twined together, joined lips forgot<br/>How the shadows fall when day is done,<br/>And when Love is not.<br/><br/>We have made no vows - there will none be broke,<br/>Our love was free as the wind on the hill,<br/>There was no word said we need wish unspoke,<br/>We have wrought no ill.<br/><br/>So shall we not part at the end of day,<br/>Who have loved and lingered a little while,<br/>Join lips for the last time, go our way,<br/>With a sigh, a smile.

Anna Akhmatova,"I taught myself to live simply and wisely,<br/>to look at the sky and pray to God,<br/>and to wander long before evening<br/>to tire my superfluous worries.<br/>When the burdocks rustle in the ravine<br/>and the yellow-red rowanberry cluster droops<br/>I compose happy verses<br/>about life's decay, decay and beauty.<br/>I come back. The fluffy cat<br/>licks my palm, purrs so sweetly<br/>and the fire flares bright<br/>on the saw-mill turret by the lake.<br/>Only the cry of a stork landing on the roof<br/>occasionally breaks the silence.<br/>If you knock on my door<br/>I may not even hear.
